# E8VM

Goal: A book written in working code and markdown document that
describes how computer system works, including architecture,
assemblers, compilers, and operating systems.

Read it (here)[http://8k.lonnie.io].

Planned Features:

- **Modularized.** File based modules. No circular dependency (not only on packages,
  but also on files). A reader can always read the project a file by
  a file, either from bottom to top, or from top to bottom.
- **Small files.** Each file is shorter than 200 lines of code.
- **Tested and Documented.**
  Each file (will) come with test cases, examples, and markdown description.
- **Real.** The simulation (will) work like a real computer.

## TODOs

- Improve code reading website
- Complete consts
- Package building system
- More tests
- Online filesystem and online editing
- Linking github
