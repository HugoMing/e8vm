## About a testing framework

the compiler now can compile, but it relies on an external file system

- a building file system
- a source folder, where source files are organized into packages, and
  each file in the folder has the same suffix. this is useful for
  searching files in a file system
- a log folder, for writing log files. each log file has a name.
- a lib folder, for writing lib. each lib is a single file.
- a bin folder, for writing binaries
