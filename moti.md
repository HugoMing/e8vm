# Towards Literally Readable Code

## Why readable code?

- Coding gets popular
- Code is *the* way to unambiguously record working logic
- For writers, easier to maintain 
- For readers, easier to understand
- To communicate and preserve knowledge
- Build a sound foundation for the future of computation

## Reality

- Language has too many corner features, everyone uses a different
  subset
- Projects are often complex and monolithic
- Toolchains require hours to setup, weeks to learn
- Documentations are hard to maintain, often out of date

Deeper reasons:

- Readability is never the primary design goal
- No effective feedback loop on improving readability
- Most code lives shorter than human, if have questions, just ask the author

## Dream: Let code talk and live

- Language is even smaller than Go, can be learnt 100%
- Project is composed of small files with no circular dependencies, natually layered
- Toolchains needs no setup. Code compiles and runs inside browser with one click.
- Documentations are only for explaining teh non-obvious

Coding is literature.

## Near future plan (2 years)

- A code blog/book online website
- A small language and compiler
- A simple architecture that is synthesized inside the browser
- A versioning Dropbox-like online file system
- Files are modules, dependency units; folders are packages, compilation units.
- Every file must be small, 300 lines x 80 chars maximum.
- No circular dependency.
- Dog food eating: write an OS that can compile itself.
- Goal: on the website, people can start reading and providing readability feedback

## Far future plan (5-10 years)

- With the feedback, learn more on how to write readable code
- Accumulate some reviewed/rated highly readable code
- Encourage people to participate with online currency
- Build a library/wiki of code
- Build online coding courses and games
- Build an online coding/logic Q&A website
- Build an online code market
- Be the best programmer headhunting platform
